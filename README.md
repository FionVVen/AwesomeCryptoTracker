# Project title: Awesome Crypto-Currency Portfolio Tracker

Crypto currencies have seen significant growth over the past 5 years from around USD $7.17 billion in January 2016 to around USD $1.04 trillion in January 2021. Yet many people are still somewhat in the dark about it.

The purpose of our application is to enable a prospective investor to build a mock portfolio of crypto currencies. They can:
- Select coins from the top 10 by market size
- Obtain current prices, market size and latest performance
- Assemble a mock portfolio and track your profit or loss
- Access the latest news on crypto currencies

# Motivation

Members of our team have an interest in learning more about crypto currencies but not necessarily have the money to invest at the moment. We feel one of the best ways to learn is to experience how it works, particularly the different types of crypto currencies available, prices range, price changes and potential profit or loss.

# Coding requirements

We used APIs to access up-to-date market data on the top 10 crypto currencies by market value. This includes their unit price, market size and price change in the past 24 hours. We also used another API to access the latest news articles available on crypto currencies. APIs utilised include the following:
https://www.cryptocompare.com/api#
https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api


From a styling point of view, we utilised the W3.CSS framework. This was relatively comprehensive, easy to use and most importanly is freely available. Font awesome was used in line with the name of our application.

We also utilised the jQuery libary to make the programming a lot more accessible.
